            <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
            <p>"Robert John Downey Jr. (born April 4, 1965) is an American actor and producer. His career has been
                characterized by critical and popular success in his youth, followed by a period of substance abuse and
                legal troubles, before a resurgence of commercial success later in his career. In 2008, Downey was named
                by Time magazine among the 100 most influential people in the world, and from 2013 to 2015, he was
                listed by Forbes as Hollywood's highest-paid actor. Robert Downey Jr. has evolved into one of the most
                respected actors in Hollywood. With an amazing list of credits to his name, he has managed to stay new
                and fresh even after over four decades in the business."</p>
